##Introduction
>This is an eCommerce site that I only developed for the subject 'Electronic Business Strategy, Architecture and Design' in my 3rd year.  No external CMS such as Magento/Drupal used.

##Deployment
>Just deploy like any other web project. All files except .sql file should go to the context root. .sql should imported then(lull_a_buy_db). sometimes db connection properties should configured accoriding to.

##Issues
> Only *baby food in Baby Food* menu, *Outfits in clothing* menu and *Baby and infant toys in Toys* menu are containg Items (since it is not for real deployment). 
   And *delivery policy in footer menu* contains delivery charges(Sri Lankan districts).
> Seems like *chrome has a one issue with css* (Checkout button in top dosen't seems to obey the top value that I used for relative positioning ). :/ But *Mozzila,IE7+(of course),Opera displays it fine*. *admin is the username knights is the password* for admin panel. 
  At first the delivery cost is not shown at the top viewing cart. After visit the shopping cart it is updated just fine :)
 
> Its nothing much. You can use it for anything as u like. Hope this will be usefull for some one (or might not). Anyway, thank you.
