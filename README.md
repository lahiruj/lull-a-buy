Introduction
-This is an eCommerce site that I only developed for the subject 'Electronic Business Strategy, Architecture and Design' in my 3rd year. No any CMS is used like Magento is used.

Deployment
-Just deploy like any other web project. All files except .sql file should go to the context root. .sql should imported then(lull_a_buy_db). sometimes db connection properties should configured acooriding to! 

Issues
- Only baby food in Baby Food menu, Outfits in clothing menu and Baby and infant toys in Toys menu are containg Items (since it is not for real deployment). 
   And delivery policy in footer menu contains delivery charges(Sri Lankan districts).
- Seems like chrome has a one issue with css! :/ but Mozzila,IE7+(of course),Opera displays it fine. admin is the username knights is the password for admin panel. 
  At first the delivery cost is not shown at the top viewing cart. After visit the shopping cart it is updated just fine :)
 
 Its nothing much. You can use it for anything as u like. Hope this will be usefull for some one (or might not). Anyway, thank you!
